## Installation

```
npm install --save use-moxie
```

## Usage

Use the `useMoxie` hook by passing along a `username` and `collection` as props:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useMoxie } from 'use-moxie';

const Example = () => {
	const { data, didInitialFetch, loading } = useMoxie({
		username: '@itsjonq',
		collection: 'use-moxie-demo',
	});

	if (!didInitialFetch && loading) {
		return <div>...</div>;
	}

	return (
		<div>
			{data.map((entry) => (
				<div key={entry.id}>{entry.message}</div>
			))}
		</div>
	);
};
```

## API

### useMoxie({ username, collection, actionReducer })

#### `username`

Type: `string`

Your username for Moxie. It must start with an `@`. Example: `@itsjonq`.

#### `collection`

Type: `string`

The name of the collection for your data. If it doesn't exist under your Moxie username, Moxie will create it for you automatically when you add your first entry.

#### `actionReducer`

Type: `function`

A callback function that dispatches events when `useMoxie` performs API actions.

Example:

```jsx
const { actions, data, didInitialFetch, loading } = useMoxie({
	username: '@itsjonq',
	collection: 'use-moxie-demo',
	actionReducer: (type) => console.log(type),
});
```

| Action Type      | Description                                        |

| `GET_OFFLINE`    | `get` request bypassed. Currently offline.         |
| `POST_FAILED`    | `post` request has failed.                         |
| `POST_STARTED`   | `post` request has started.                        |
| `POST_SUCCESS`   | `post` request has succeed.                        |
| `POST_OFFLINE`   | `post` request saved locally. Currently offline.   |
| `PUT_FAILED`     | `put` request has failed.                          |
| `PUT_STARTED`    | `put` request has started.                         |

## Props

The `useMoxie` hook provides a handful of useful props:

```jsx
const {
	actions,
	data,
	didInitialFetch,
	hasData,
	isPending,
	pending,
	loading,
} = useMoxie({
	username: '@itsjonq',
	collection: 'use-moxie-demo',
});
```

#### `actions`

Type: `object`

Actions contains a collection of RESTful actions you can perform on your Moxie collection:

| Method                | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `actions.get(id?)`    | Fetches your collection. Can fetch an individual entry if an `id` (`string`) is provided.  |
| `actions.post(data)`  | Adds a new entry. The `data` argument needs to be an `object`.                             |
| `actions.put(data)`   | Updates an entry. The `data` argument needs to be an `object` with an `id`.                |
| `actions.patch(data)` | Updates an entry. The `data` argument needs to be an `object` with an `id`.                |
| `actions.remove(id?)` | Removes your collection. Can remove an individual entry if an `id` (`string`) is provided. |

#### `data`

Type: `Array`

The collection of your entries.

#### `didInitialFetch`

Type: `boolean`

`useMoxie` does an initial `GET` request for your collection on load. This property indicates whether that initial request has been performed. This is useful for rendering an initial loading UI.

#### `hasData`

Type: `boolean`

Whether your collection has entries.

#### `isPending`

Type: `function(object|string)`

Checks whether an entry is being processed. An entry is considered "pending" after an action is called, but before it is fully resolved from Moxie.

##### Example:

```js
<div key={entry.id}>
	{entry.title}
	<br />
	{isPending(entry) ? 'Ready' : '...'}
</div>
```

#### `loading`

Type: `boolean`

`useMoxie` toggles this property whenever an action is performed.

#### `pending`

Type: `Array<string>`

An array of entries (ids) that are currently being processed. An entry is considered "pending" after an action is called, but before it is fully resolved from Moxie.

## Example

## Offline Support

`useMoxie` has some basic offline support. It will save actions to `localStorage` while you are offline. Once you're back online, it will try to synchronize the offline modifications.
